      <description>By understanding the customer, marketers can launch a targeted marketing campaign that is tailored for specific needs. If data about the customers is available, data science can be applied to perform market segmentation
In this case study, you have been hired as a consultant to a bank in New York City. The bank has extensive data on their customers for the past 6 months. The marketing team at the bank wants to launch a targeted ad marketing campaign by dividing their customers into at least 3 distinctive groups.</description>

      <description>Built a serverless web application from start to deployment on the web using Azure services - and with no standalone services or server instances at all! Azure will add more server power when your application needs it, and will take care of scaling back down when you don&amp;rsquo;t. And you only pay for what you use.
Learnt to use the following Azure services:
  Storing Data in Cosmos DB: Introduced Cosmos DB which is Azure&amp;rsquo;s multi-model database offering and create database for project</description>

      <description>The objective of this case study is to forecast weekly retail store sales based on historical data. This dataset contains weekly sales from 99 departments belonging to 45 different stores. The data contains holidays and promotional markdowns offered by various stores and several departments throughout the year . Markdowns are crucial to promote sales especially before key events such as Super Bowl, Christmas and Thanksgiving. Developing accurate model will enable make informed decisions and make recommendations to improve business processes in the future.</description>

      <description>For companies to become competitive and skyrocket their growth, they need to leverage AI/ML to develop predictive models to forecast sales in the future. Predictive models attempt at forecasting future sales based on historical data while taking into account seasonality effects, demand, holidays, promotions, and competition. In this project, you work as a data scientist in the sales department and the sales team provided you with data from 1115 stores. The objective is to predict future daily sales based on the features.</description>

      <description>In our entire analysis, we have done everything right from data preprocessing to optimal model selection and tuning the selected optimal model. We achieved all this by doing the following:
 Reshaping the 3D features to 2D features, performed one-hot encoding on the target variables, normalizing the range of the features and reducing the high-dimensional features by implementing PCA. Deploying a simple 2 layered neural network model without any regularization and comparing this modelâ€™s performance to the performance of the 2 layered regularized neural network.</description>

      <description>Patients admitted to the ICU suffer from critical illness or injury and are at high risk of dying. ICU mortality rates differ widely depending on the underlying disease process, with death rates as low as 1 in 20 for patients admitted following elective surgery, and as high as 1 in 4 for patients with respiratory diseases. The risk of death can be approximated by evaluating the severity of a patientâ€™s illness as determined by important physiologic, clinical, and demographic determinants.</description>

      <description>The Game allows users to test how well they know their multiplication table, each question comes with multiple answers; only one is correct.
  At the end of the test, the user is issued a score equal to the number of correct answers submitted during the game.
  Designed an advanced original algorithm which operates the flow of the game and does everything from starting the game counter, to issuing multiple answers, until ending the game and displaying the score.</description>
